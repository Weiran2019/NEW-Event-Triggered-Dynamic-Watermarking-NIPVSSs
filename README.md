# Attack Detection for Networked Control Systems Using Event-Triggered Dynamic Watermarking
## Introduction
We have investigated attack detection of networked control systems developing a new event-triggered dynamic watermarking (ETDW) scheme. Here, we release the code of our paper for the new ETDW scheme used in the networked inverted pendulum visual servo systems (NIPVSSs).
## Demo and data
The demo is divided into 2 folders in ```ADNCSETDW_code``` using the MATLAB. Run the .m file in the every folders. The requried data is included in the every folders too.
## Ethical proof
All experimental procedures were approved by the Shanghai Key Laboratory of Power Station Automation Technology, School of Mechatronical Engineering and Automation, Shanghai University, Shanghai 200444, China.
